This is the repository for my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. I'm still currently exploring this way of development but I'm loving it so far. I'm currently using the [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) distribution. Hopefully, as I continually explore I'd be able to slowly migrate to my own fully custom configuration. Still, LazyVim is great, kudos to the team who developed this!
